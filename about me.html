                        Hello..! This is me Md. Shohanur Rahaman Sohag. I am from Tangail. 
                        I am Computer Science And Engineering Student From Daffodil International University. 
                        My batch cse-55 and Initial 201.

                        Now, I am going to talk about my educational background.First of all, I talk about my SSC Certificate.
                        Well, I was a student of  Sristy Academic School,Tangail. In 2017, I passed SSC Examination and got GPA-5. 
                        According to my result, I got chance in Milestone College,Uttara. Then ,in 2019, I passed HSC Examination and I got GPA-5.
                        After completing my HSC exam, I decided to gain a Bachelor degree. I research more and more then I find Daffodil International University. 
                        Daffodil International University is one of the best university for CSE. So, I admitted into Daffodil International University and 
                        I got 60% scholarship. But the condition is I have to gain 3.25 in every semester. It inspires me to improve the quality of my studies.
                        Daffodil International University arranges a program each year to accelerate the pace of learning. 
                        The name of the program is ‘One Student One Laptop’. Daffodil International University is the only university in Bangladesh which provide 
                        one laptop to each student. I think this is the a landmark step for DIU. Due to best researcher university DIU helps me to achieve some skills. I am already able to program languages like C,C++, Java, Python, Html etc. After completing my B.Sc I want to go other country for higher education. Then I want to build my dream to be a developer in Multinational Company. 
                        That's all about me...!
                        Thank You For Visiting My Profile...!
